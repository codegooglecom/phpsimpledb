A filter is a very primitive function currently. Only simple comparisons are support and only "and" or "or". Filters cannot be performed on a non-index item, specified in *`$__indexes`*. They are also very dangerous to user into since you can use any and ever php function in a filter, someone could possibly remove vital parts of your application's database.

{{{
include_once 'lib.simpledb.php';

class Users extends SimpleDb
{
    protected $__indexes = array('username', 'password', 'active');
    public $username;
    public $password;
    public $lastlogin;
    public $active = true;
}

//-- Fetch a user by a primary index
$user = $users->fetch(1);
echo $user->username;

//-- Fetch a user by username index
$username = addslashes($_POST['username']);
$password = addslashes($_POST['password']);
$users = new Users('dbfolder');
$userids = $users
    ->filter("username == '{$username}' and password == '{$password}'")
    ->query();
$userid = array_shift($userids);
$user = $users->fetch($userid);
echo $user->username;


//-- Fetch many users
$users = new Users('dbfolder');
$userids = $users
    ->order('-active, +username') //-- sorts by active usernames
    ->query();

//-- Iterate result set
while($userid = array_shift($userids)) {
    $user = $users->fetch($userid);
    echo $user->username;
}
